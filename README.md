# CS231n-Assignments
Course assignments for cs231n: [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).

**Some interesting things implemented in the assignments:**
* Captioning on MS-COCO using RNNS and LSTMS
* Deconvolutional Layers
* Deep Dream
* Class Saliency Maps
* GANS: LSGANs and DCGANs

All assignments are completed using tensorflow 2.
**A big thank you to all the guys behind CS231n for making this amazing course free for all.**
